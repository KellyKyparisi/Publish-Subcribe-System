# Publish / Subscribe System – Data Structures (HY240)

This project implements a simulated publish/subscribe system developed as part of the **HY240 – Data Structures** course at the University of Crete.

## Overview
The system processes a sequence of events related to information publication and subscriber management, demonstrating how dynamic data structures can be used to model evolving system states.

## Project Phases
- **Phase 1:** Core publish/subscribe functionality using fundamental data structures.
- **Phase 2:** Extension with more advanced data structures to improve data organization and efficiency.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of data structures and algorithms  
- Low-level programming in C and memory management  
- Structured problem-solving and modular code design

## Technologies
- C
- Pointers & dynamic memory
- Linked data structures
